# Typography System Standardization Summary

## Changes Implemented

We've standardized the typography hierarchy across all components in the IRCS Certification microsite to ensure consistency and improve visual hierarchy:

### 1. Heading Component Usage

- **Hero Section**
  - Implemented `<Heading level="1" size="xl">` for the main page title

- **Section Components**
  - Standardized section titles with `<Heading level="2" size="lg">` in all major sections:
    - About
    - Benefits
    - Certified 
    - Contact
    - Costs
    - Enroll

- **Card & Component Titles**
  - Updated all card titles and subsection headers to use the appropriate heading level:
    - Benefits component: Updated card titles from direct `h3` tags to `<Heading level="3" size="sm">`
    - Contact component: Updated all headings to use the `<Heading>` component with appropriate levels (2, 3, 4)
    - Costs component: Standardized program header to use `<Heading level="3" size="sm">`
    - Enroll component: Updated section title to use `<Heading level="2" size="lg">`

### 2. InfoBox Value Typography

- **Standardized Value Display**
  - InfoBox: Maintained `text-3xl` for values
  - InfoBoxHorizontal: Updated from `text-2xl` to `text-3xl` for values
  - InfoBoxMinimal: Updated from `text-4xl` to `text-3xl` for values

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**
   - Clear differentiation between page titles, section titles, and subsection titles
   - Consistent sizing provides better visual flow through the page

2. **Semantic HTML Structure**
   - Proper use of heading levels (h1-h6) improves accessibility
   - Screen readers can now navigate the page structure more effectively

3. **Maintainable Code**
   - Centralized typography through the `<Heading>` component
   - Future typography changes can be made in one place

4. **Consistent User Experience**
   - Unified visual language across all sections
   - Statistical values have consistent visual weight

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**
   - The complete typography system is documented in `TypographySystem.md`
   - New components should follow these typography guidelines

2. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Continue to use the `<Heading>` component for all heading elements
   - Maintain the standardized text sizes for values across InfoBox variants
