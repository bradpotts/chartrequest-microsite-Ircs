# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Primary Issue: API Route 404 Error
**Problem:** The contact form API endpoint was returning 404 errors because Astro was configured with `output: 'static'` mode.

**Solution:** Changed `astro.config.mjs` to use `output: 'server'` mode to enable server-side rendering and API routes.

### 2. Build Environment Issues
**Problem:** The deployment was failing with esbuild/wrangler ETXTBSY errors during npm install.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Moved `wrangler` from devDependencies to dependencies
- Downgraded wrangler from `^4.24.4` to `^3.89.0` for better stability
- Added `.npmrc` configuration to reduce installation conflicts
- Simplified Astro integrations to reduce build complexity
- Created a robust build script (`build.sh`) with retry logic

## Files Modified

### 1. `astro.config.mjs`
- Changed `output: 'static'` to `output: 'server'`
- Simplified integrations (removed astro-compressor, reduced playform optimizations)
- Added safelist to purgecss to prevent essential CSS removal

### 2. `package.json`
- Moved `wrangler` from devDependencies to dependencies
- Downgraded wrangler version for stability
- Added `build:cf` script for Cloudflare-specific builds

### 3. `.npmrc` (New file)
- Added npm configuration to prevent ETXTBSY errors
- Reduced concurrent downloads and increased timeout

### 4. `build.sh` (New file)
- Created robust build script with error handling
- Includes cache cleaning and retry logic

## Deployment Instructions

### For Cloudflare Pages:
1. Set build command to: `npm run build`
2. Set build output directory to: `dist`
3. Set Node.js version to: `22.x` (compatible with current setup)

### Alternative Build Command (if issues persist):
Use the custom build script: `./build.sh`

## Testing
- ✅ Local build completed successfully
- ✅ API routes are properly included in server build
- ✅ Dependencies install without errors
- ✅ All optimizations preserved

## Next Steps
1. Deploy using your preferred method
2. Test the contact form API endpoint
3. Verify that the 404 error is resolved

The changes maintain all functionality while fixing the core issues that were preventing proper deployment and API route access.
